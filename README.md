# Project Title 
User Profile Validation System

## Description 
This project validates user profile details such as full name, email ID, mobile number and age in python using conditional statements, strings and very simple basic functions.

## Features 
This project takes the full name,email ID, mobile number and age from the user.
It checks whether the full name contains a space and does not start or end with a space character.
It checks the email ID has both '@' and '.' and make sure that @ is not the first character.
It verifies that the mobile number has exactly 10 digits and does not start with zero.
It checks whether the age is between 18 and 60 (inclusive).

## Technologies used 
- python
- conditional statements
- strings and string indexing
- basic functions such as isdigit()

## How It Works
The program has to verify a user profile by taking the full name, email Id, mobile number as string inputs and age as integer input from the user. By using only data types, strings and conditional statements. If all the given validation rules are satisfied then we have to print that user profile is valid. Otherwise, it is not valid.

## How To Run
1. Open the file main.py.
2. Run the program in python.
3. Enter the details that has been asked to check whether the user profile is valid or not.

## Learning Outcomes 
Through thsi project,I have learnt how to take user inputs as strings and how to implement them in the conditional statements and also how to use the basic string functions like length checking, counting the characters by using the count() and indexing to check the positions of characters. I also learnt how to use the basic functions such as isdigit().
